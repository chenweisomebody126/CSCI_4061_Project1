We work together in CSE labs for the entire project.

Basic implementation, recursion to fork and exec, testing and commenting were done together.
More particularly, Sushmitha and Christopher implemented the functionality of Status bit field in the targets.
Wei implemented the timestamp checking for the tree along the depth-first recursion.
